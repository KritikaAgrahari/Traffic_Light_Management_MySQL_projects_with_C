# Traffic_Light_Management_MySQL_projects_with_C
A Smart City Traffic Management system is an excellent choice for a capstone project. It involves using technology to monitor, manage, and optimize traffic flow in a city to improve efficiency, reduce congestion, and enhance overall transportation experiences. Hereâ€™s a comprehensive guide on how you can approach this project:

## Project Overview
### Objective: 
Develop a database system to manage and analyze traffic data collected from various sensors across a city. The goal is to optimize traffic flow, monitor congestion, and provide actionable insights.

# Key Components

#### [1. Database Design](#database-Schema)
#### [2. Data Collection](#data-collection)
#### [3. Query Development](#query-development)
#### [4. Performance Optimization](#performance-optimization)
#### [5. Visualization and Reporting](#visulization-and-reporting)
#### [6. Real-Time Data Integration](#real-time-data-integration)




##  Database Schema
The system uses a MySQL database with the following tables:

#### Traffic_Sensors
- **SensorID** (Primary Key, INT)
- **Location** (VARCHAR)
- **Type** (VARCHAR, e.g., camera, loop sensor)
- **InstallationDate** (DATE)

#### Traffic_Data
- **DataID** (Primary Key, INT)
- **SensorID** (Foreign Key, INT)
- **Timestamp** (DATETIME)
- **VehicleCount** (INT)
- **AverageSpeed** (FLOAT)
- **OccupancyRate** (FLOAT)

#### Traffic_Lights
- **TrafficLightID** (Primary Key, INT)
- **Location** (VARCHAR)
- **Status** (VARCHAR, e.g., Red, Green, Yellow)
- **LastChangeTime** (DATETIME)

#### Traffic_Incidents
- **IncidentID** (Primary Key, INT)
- **Timestamp** (DATETIME)
- **Location** (VARCHAR)
- **Description** (TEXT)
- **Severity** (VARCHAR, e.g., Minor, Major)

#### Traffic_Reports
- **ReportID** (Primary Key, INT)
- **Timestamp** (DATETIME)
- **ReportType** (VARCHAR, e.g., Daily Summary, Peak Hour Analysis)
- **Details** (TEXT)

## Data Collection

### Sensor Integration
Set up various sensors throughout the city to collect real-time data on traffic conditions.

### Data Logging
Ensure that data from sensors is logged consistently and accurately into the database.

### Data Sources
Consider integrating data from external sources like weather reports or public transportation schedules for a comprehensive analysis.


## Query Devlopment
### Monitor Traffic Flow
```sql
SELECT Location, AVG(VehicleCount) AS AvgVehicleCount, AVG(AverageSpeed) AS AvgSpeed
FROM Traffic_Data
WHERE Timestamp BETWEEN '2024-08-01' AND '2024-08-31'
GROUP BY Location;
```
### Identify Congestion Patterns
```sql
SELECT Location, Timestamp, VehicleCount, AverageSpeed
FROM Traffic_Data
WHERE VehicleCount > 100 AND AverageSpeed < 20
ORDER BY Timestamp;
```
### Traffic Incident Reports
```sql
SELECT Location, Description, Severity
FROM Traffic_Incidents
WHERE Timestamp > DATE_SUB(NOW(), INTERVAL 1 DAY)
ORDER BY Severity DESC;
```

## Performance Optimization

#### Indexing
- **Create indexes** on frequently queried columns such as `Timestamp`, `Location`, and `VehicleCount` to speed up queries.

#### Partitioning
- **Partition large tables** by date or location to improve performance and manageability.

#### Query Optimization
- **Analyze slow-running queries** and optimize them by rewriting the query or adding necessary indexes.

## Visualization and Reporting

#### Dashboards
- **Create interactive dashboards** using tools like Tableau, Power BI, or Grafana to visualize traffic patterns, congestion areas, and incident reports.

#### Reports
- **Generate regular reports** summarizing traffic conditions, peak times, and incident statistics.

## Real-Time Data Integration

#### Data Streaming
- **Use technologies** like Apache Kafka or MQTT to handle real-time data streams from traffic sensors.

#### Alerts
- **Implement real-time alerts** for traffic incidents or congestion that can trigger actions such as adjusting traffic light timings.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **C Compiler**: Ensure you have a C compiler (like GCC) installed.
- **MySQL Server**: Install and configure MySQL server.
- **MySQL Connector/C**: Required to connect C programs with MySQL databases.

## Setup and Installation

### MySQL Server Setup
1. **Install MySQL Server**:
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install mysql-server
2. **Secure MySQL Installation**:
   ```sh
   sudo mysql_secure_installation
3. **Create DATABASE**:
   ```sh
   CREATE DATABASE Traffic_management;

## MySQL Connector/C Setup
4. **Install MySQL Connector/C**:
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev
### Project Setup

5. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone <https://github.com/KritikaAgrahari/Traffic_Light_Management_MySQL_projects_with_C.git/>

cd traffic-management-system
gcc -o traffic_management main.c -lymsqlclient
./traffic_management

## Sample Commands

Below are some example commands used in the traffic management system:

### Add Traffic Sensor:
```bash
add_traffic_sensor("Camera", "Main St & 3rd Ave", "2024-01-10");
```

## Usage
### Add Users:
- Add Traffic Managers and Traffic Officers.

### Monitor Traffic:
- Track real-time traffic conditions and incidents.


### Manage Traffic Signals:
- Adjust traffic lights to control flow and reduce congestion.


### Incident Reporting:
- Report and respond to traffic incidents and hazards.
