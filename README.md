# Traffic_Light_Management_MySQL_projects_with_C
A Smart City Traffic Management system is an excellent choice for a capstone project. It involves using technology to monitor, manage, and optimize traffic flow in a city to improve efficiency, reduce congestion, and enhance overall transportation experiences. Hereâ€™s a comprehensive guide on how you can approach this project:

## Project Overview
### Objective: 
Develop a database system to manage and analyze traffic data collected from various sensors across a city. The goal is to optimize traffic flow, monitor congestion, and provide actionable insights.

# Key Components

#### 1. Database Design
#### 2. Data Collection
#### 3. Query Development
#### 4. Performance Optimization
#### 5. Visualization and Reporting
#### 6. Real-Time Data Integration




## Database Schema
The system uses a MySQL database with the following tables:

#### Traffic_Sensors
- **SensorID** (Primary Key, INT)
- **Location** (VARCHAR)
- **Type** (VARCHAR, e.g., camera, loop sensor)
- **InstallationDate** (DATE)

#### Traffic_Data
- **DataID** (Primary Key, INT)
- **SensorID** (Foreign Key, INT)
- **Timestamp** (DATETIME)
- **VehicleCount** (INT)
- **AverageSpeed** (FLOAT)
- **OccupancyRate** (FLOAT)

#### Traffic_Lights
- **TrafficLightID** (Primary Key, INT)
- **Location** (VARCHAR)
- **Status** (VARCHAR, e.g., Red, Green, Yellow)
- **LastChangeTime** (DATETIME)

#### Traffic_Incidents
- **IncidentID** (Primary Key, INT)
- **Timestamp** (DATETIME)
- **Location** (VARCHAR)
- **Description** (TEXT)
- **Severity** (VARCHAR, e.g., Minor, Major)

#### Traffic_Reports
- **ReportID** (Primary Key, INT)
- **Timestamp** (DATETIME)
- **ReportType** (VARCHAR, e.g., Daily Summary, Peak Hour Analysis)
- **Details** (TEXT)

## 2. Data Collection

### Sensor Integration
Set up various sensors throughout the city to collect real-time data on traffic conditions.

### Data Logging
Ensure that data from sensors is logged consistently and accurately into the database.

### Data Sources
Consider integrating data from external sources like weather reports or public transportation schedules for a comprehensive analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **C Compiler**: Ensure you have a C compiler (like GCC) installed.
- **MySQL Server**: Install and configure MySQL server.
- **MySQL Connector/C**: Required to connect C programs with MySQL databases.

## Setup and Installation

### MySQL Server Setup
1. **Install MySQL Server**:
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install mysql-server
2. **Secure MySQL Installation**:
   ```sh
   sudo mysql_secure_installation
3. **Create DATABASE**:
   ```sh
   CREATE DATABASE Event_management;

## MySQL Connector/C Setup
4. **Install MySQL Connector/C**:
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev

### Project Setup
5. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone <https://github.com/TheShyamTripathi/Event_Management_systems_projectUsing_SQL_AND_C/>
6. **Navigate to Project Directory**:
   ```sh
   cd event-management-system
7. **Compile the program**:
   ```sh
   gcc -o event-management main.c -lymsqlclient
8. **Run the Program**:
   ```sh
   ./event_management

## Sample Commands

Below are some example commands used in the system:

### Add User:
```perl
add_user("John Doe", "john@example.com", "Organizer");
```
### Create Event:
```bash
   create_event("Tech Conference", "2024-09-15", "10:00 AM", "Auditorium");
```
### Register for Event:
```bash
   register_for_event(2, 5); // UserID = 2, EventID = 5
```
### Mark Attendence:
```bash
   mark_attendance(2, 5); // UserID = 2, EventID = 5
```

## Usage
### Add Users:
- Organizers and participants can be added to the system.

### Create Events:
- Organizers can create events by providing details like title, date, time, and location.

### Register for Events:
- Participants can browse available events and register for them.

### Track Attendance:
- The system allows attendance marking for participants who attend events.
