# Traffic_Light_Management_MySQL_projects_with_C
A Smart City Traffic Management system is an excellent choice for a capstone project. It involves using technology to monitor, manage, and optimize traffic flow in a city to improve efficiency, reduce congestion, and enhance overall transportation experiences. Hereâ€™s a comprehensive guide on how you can approach this project:

## Project Overview
### Objective: 
Develop a database system to manage and analyze traffic data collected from various sensors across a city. The goal is to optimize traffic flow, monitor congestion, and provide actionable insights.

# Key Components

### [1. Database Design](#database-Schema)
#### 2. Data Collection
#### 3. Query Development
#### 4. Performance Optimization
#### 5. Visualization and Reporting
#### 6. Real-Time Data Integration




## Database Schema
The system uses a MySQL database with the following tables:

#### Traffic_Sensors
- **SensorID** (Primary Key, INT)
- **Location** (VARCHAR)
- **Type** (VARCHAR, e.g., camera, loop sensor)
- **InstallationDate** (DATE)

#### Traffic_Data
- **DataID** (Primary Key, INT)
- **SensorID** (Foreign Key, INT)
- **Timestamp** (DATETIME)
- **VehicleCount** (INT)
- **AverageSpeed** (FLOAT)
- **OccupancyRate** (FLOAT)

#### Traffic_Lights
- **TrafficLightID** (Primary Key, INT)
- **Location** (VARCHAR)
- **Status** (VARCHAR, e.g., Red, Green, Yellow)
- **LastChangeTime** (DATETIME)

#### Traffic_Incidents
- **IncidentID** (Primary Key, INT)
- **Timestamp** (DATETIME)
- **Location** (VARCHAR)
- **Description** (TEXT)
- **Severity** (VARCHAR, e.g., Minor, Major)

#### Traffic_Reports
- **ReportID** (Primary Key, INT)
- **Timestamp** (DATETIME)
- **ReportType** (VARCHAR, e.g., Daily Summary, Peak Hour Analysis)
- **Details** (TEXT)

## 2. Data Collection

### Sensor Integration
Set up various sensors throughout the city to collect real-time data on traffic conditions.

### Data Logging
Ensure that data from sensors is logged consistently and accurately into the database.

### Data Sources
Consider integrating data from external sources like weather reports or public transportation schedules for a comprehensive analysis.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
- **C Compiler**: Ensure you have a C compiler (like GCC) installed.
- **MySQL Server**: Install and configure MySQL server.
- **MySQL Connector/C**: Required to connect C programs with MySQL databases.

## Setup and Installation

### MySQL Server Setup
1. **Install MySQL Server**:
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install mysql-server
2. **Secure MySQL Installation**:
   ```sh
   sudo mysql_secure_installation
3. **Create DATABASE**:
   ```sh
   CREATE DATABASE Traffic_management;

## MySQL Connector/C Setup
4. **Install MySQL Connector/C**:
   ```sh
   sudo apt-get install libmysqlclient-dev
### Project Setup

5. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```sh
   git clone <https://github.com/KritikaAgrahari/Traffic_Management_System.git>

cd traffic-management-system
gcc -o traffic_management main.c -lymsqlclient
./traffic_management

## Sample Commands

Below are some example commands used in the traffic management system:

### Add Traffic Sensor:
```bash
add_traffic_sensor("Camera", "Main St & 3rd Ave", "2024-01-10");
```

## Usage
### Add Users:
- Add Traffic Managers and Traffic Officers.

### Monitor Traffic:
- Track real-time traffic conditions and incidents.


### Manage Traffic Signals:
- Adjust traffic lights to control flow and reduce congestion.


### Incident Reporting:
- Report and respond to traffic incidents and hazards.
